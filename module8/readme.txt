readed about how to make extension for github but has not reached any solution.
so decided to make website by flask as it is in python and also all our work in python only so it will be easy to use all the thing like classifier and other stuff.

we do not no much about extensions, since github is website how can we add something there.

by chrome extensions we can manipulate content of pages of website, if it will be useful then we will try to make chrome extension for github.
