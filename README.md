# A Tool to categorize and prioritize github issues
## Motivation
- Most of the github repositories have a huge number of issues which makes it difficult for the software developers and owners of the repository  to find issues that need to be addressed immediately.

- This workload can be reduced by dividing the issues into categories namely development, security, documentation and few others.

- Along with categorizing, prioritizing the issues in those categories would make the work easier.

## How to prioritize ?
- assign weightage to the issues.

- based on their importance like -
security related issues > bugs > enhancement > documentation > question > other

- un-assigned issues > assigned issues

- based on author association (owner > member > collaborator > contributor)

- based on discussion on issues (number of comments)
